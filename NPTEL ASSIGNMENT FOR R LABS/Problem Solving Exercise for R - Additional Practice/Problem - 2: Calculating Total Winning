## Calculating total winnings
```
Now that you have the poker and roulette winnings nicely as named vectors, you can start doing some data analytical magic.
```
### You want to find out the following type of information:
```
How much has been your overall profit or loss per day of the week?
Have you lost money over the week in total?
Are you winning/losing money on poker or on roulette?
To get the answers, you have to do arithmetic calculations on vectors.
```
### It is important to know that if you sum two vectors in R, it takes the element-wise sum. For example, the following three statements are completely equivalent:
```
c(1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6)
c(1 + 4, 2 + 5, 3 + 6)
c(5, 7, 9)
#### You can also do the calculations with variables that represent vectors:

a <- c(1, 2, 3) 
b <- c(4, 5, 6)
c <- a + b
```
